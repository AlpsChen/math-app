# 會考會考的數學 Mathematics Applied To Huikao (MATH)

According to official survey, Taiwanese students under 20 years old spent more than four hours a day on their mobile phones in 2017. It is indeed the world record. Therefore, I utilized **React Native** — a *state-of-the-art*, *cross-platform*, and *conditional rendering* programming language — to develop an unique **Mathematics Quiz App** for Taiwanese students to prepare for the high school entrance examination “on their phones”.
