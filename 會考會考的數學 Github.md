# 會考會考的數學 Mathematics Applied To Huikao (MATH)

According to official survey, Taiwanese students under 20 years old spent more than four hours a day on their mobile phones in 2017. It is indeed the world record. Therefore, I utilized **React Native** — a *state-of-the-art*, *cross-platform*, and *conditional rendering* programming language — to develop an unique **Mathematics Quiz App** for Taiwanese students to prepare for the high school entrance examination “on their phones”.

## Getting Started

Since **React Native** features in the *cross-platform* function, the codes are 90% identical for iOS and Android. It significantly reduces the development period.

### Installing

Supports Chinese and English interfaces.


* [Available in **Google Play**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tech.alpschen.mathApp)
* Coming soon in **App Store**

## Running the app

The app gains several outstanding features outplaying ordinary quiz apps.

### Features

1. **Five Modes**: *Adapt*, *Random*, *Easy*, *Medium*, *Hard*

2. **Virtual Scratch Paper**: write and erase with a single swipe

3. **Customized Question Rendering**: an *algorithm* determining the next question's difficulty

4. **Virtual Bookmarks**: label the difficult ones; review them later to deepen your impression

6. **Innovative Sound Effects**
	* correct? *You Have Defeated An Enemy!*
	* five correct answers in a row? *Penta Kill!*
	* next question incorrect? *Shutdown!*

7. **Deliberated Animations**

8. **Easily Upload New Math Questions [Here](http://forms.alpschen.tech)**
	
	Deployed with **React JS**, this Uploader Website is for the teachers to easily submit their own math questions. After submission, the data will be transmitted and stored in *JSON* format in my database. My app will later send request, receive *JSON* data, and convert them into straightforward, arranged texts.

### Future Roadmaps

1. **VR Integration**
	
	>**Learn in playing: The Mathematics Mario World**
	
	>My ultimate goal is to construct a virtual mathematics world. Resembling the Mario World, the student can pass each challenge through defeating the boss (math questions). Inside the world, the math questions can appear at anytime and anywhere. Whenever he/she encounter one, he/she must solve it to proceed. The student will also have to personally run through the “traps”, just like Mario. I hold the students will be engrossed in this innovative way of learning — perhaps not *learning*, but *playing*!
	
1. **AR Integration**
	
	In college, I will delve into this area in classes and my spare time.

	>**The Automatic, Intelligent Solver**
	
	>Students could scan a math question in their text book, and the app will automatically generate its solution, category, related topics, and so forth by recognizing the description and using its *AI brain*.
	

	>**The *Capricious* Package**
	
	>Another idea resembles the commonly used method to practice math, but far more *efficient*. We often practice the same kind of question for times, every time changing the numbers slightly. *So why not the app generate them for you?* With a simple scan, the app will modify the question into slightly distinct formats. They can even be shared to another users. Therefore, the question bank will be significantly widened, and the students will significantly improve by the *capricious* questions!

	
1. **Expanded Subjects**
	
	Add in distinct domains: *Chinese*, *English*, *Science*, and *Social Studies*. Expand the scale and question bank of my database.
	
1. **Game Pointing System**
	
	Vivify the tedious math solving process. The points could be gained from well performances and could be used to purchase hints or something attractive. *Perhaps some skins?*
	
1. **Individual Analysis**
	
	Analyze the students’ weaknesses and generate relevant questions. This will require the deployment of algorithms.
	
1. **Topics**

	Categorize every problem in topics. For instance, *trigonometry* or *statistics*. Develop functions for students to directly opt for the topics they crave to improve on.
	
1. **Big Data**
	
	I crave to creat statistics of all the users. Therefore, the teachers could receive the data and comprehend the needs of students.
	
1. **UI Optimization**:
	
	Ornament the interface of the app. A better user experience will not only attract users, but also bring comfort while they play with it. To achieve this, I have to dig through *animations* and *aesthetics*!
